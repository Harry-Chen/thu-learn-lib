This is a JavaScript library aimed to provide a program-friendly interface of [web Learning of Tsinghua University](https://learn.tsinghua.edu.cn). Only the newest version (learn2018) is supported.

This project is licensed under MIT License.

## Compatibility

The library uses `cross-fetch` and `real-isomorphic-fetch`, which provides cookie and redirection support in both browsers and JS engines (like node).

I don't like polyfill. In case of any problems, just upgrade your browser / Node.

## Installation

`yarn add thu-learn-lib`

## Build from source

### Library version (for development or Node)

`yarn && yarn run build-lib`

You can find the library version in `lib/`.
It can be used in web development or imported with NodeJS (with all dependencies installed).
It __should not__ be directly used in browsers.

### Bundled version (for browsers or Node)

`yarn && yarn run build-dist`

You can find the bundled version in `dist/`.
You can install it as an unpacked extension in Chrome and click the `t` icon in extension bar, then execute anything you want in the Console of Chrome Developer Tool.
The helper class is attached as `window.learn_2018_helper` in this mode.
Or you can just import `index.js` with NodeJS.

Use `yarn run watch-dist` for watching file changes.

## Usage

```javascript
import { Learn2018Helper } from 'thu-learn-lib';
import { ContentType } from 'thu-learn-lib/lib/types'

// in JS engines, each instance owns different cookie jars
const helper = new Learn2018Helper();

// all following methods are async

// first login
const loginSuccess = await helper.login('user', 'pass');
// take out cookies (e.g. for file download), which will not work in browsers
// its type is require('tough-cookie-no-native').CookieJar
console.log(helper.cookieJar);

// get ids of all semesters that current account has access to
const semesters = await helper.getSemesterIdList();

// get get semester info
const semester = await helper.getCurrentSemester();

// get courses of this semester (learned or assisted)
const courses = await helper.getCourseList(semester.id);
const TAcourses = await helper.getTACourseList(semester.id);
const course = courses[0];

// get detail information about the course
const discussions = await helper.getDiscussionList(course.id);
const notifications = await helper.getNotificationList(course.id);
const files = await helper.getFileList(course.id);
const homework = await helper.getHomeworkList(course.id);
const questions = await helper.getAnsweredQuestionList(course.id);

// get content from bunches of courses
// the return type will be { [id: string]: Content }
// where Content = Notification | File | Homework | Discussion | Question
const homeworks = await helper.getAllContents([1, 2, 3], ContentType.HOMEWORK);

// get course calendar
const calendar = await helper.getCalendar('20191001', '20191201');

// logout if you want, the cookie jar will be cleared in Node
const logoutSuccess = await helper.logout();
```

According to security strategies (CORS, CORB) of browsers, you might need to run the code in the page context of `https://learn2018.tsinghua.edu.cn` and `https://id.tsinghua.edu.cn`. The simplest way is to run the code as a browser extension.

## Typing

See `lib/types.d.ts` for type definitions.
