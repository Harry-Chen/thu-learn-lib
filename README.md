This is a JavaScript library aimed to provide a program-friendly interface of [web Learning of Tsinghua University](https://learn.tsinghua.edu.cn).

This project is licensed under MIT License.

## Compatibility

The library uses [`node-fetch-cookie-native`](https://github.com/AsakuraMizu/node-fetch-cookie-native), which is a simple wrapper for [node-fetch-native](https://github.com/unjs/node-fetch-native) and [fetch-cookie](https://github.com/valeriangalliat/fetch-cookie), providing cookie and redirection support in both browsers and Node.

In case of any syntax problems, just upgrade your browser / Node, or use any corresponding polyfills.

## Installation

### Node / Bundler

```bash
yarn add thu-learn-lib
```

### Browser (IIFE)

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/thu-learn-lib@3"></script>
<!-- or -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/thu-learn-lib@3"></script>
```

The library is exposed under `window.LearnLib`.

### Browser (ESM)

```html
<script type="module">
  import { Learn2018Helper } from 'https://esm.sh/thu-learn-lib@3';
</script>
```

## Build

```
yarn run build
```

You can find the bundled library in `lib/`.

- `index.js`: ES module entry
- `index.d.ts`: definition file for TypeScript
- `index.global.js{,.map}`: IIFE for use in browser (with source map for debugging)

## Development in browser

```
yarn run dev
```

This will open a dev browser with a testing extension. Click the `t` icon in extension bar, then execute anything you want in the Console of Chrome Developer Tool.
The library is exposed under `window.LearnLib`.

Use `yarn run dev:build` to build the extension that can be installed to your chrome browser manually.

## Usage

### Authentication related (important changes since v1.2.0)

```typescript
import { Learn2018Helper } from 'thu-learn-lib';

// There are three ways of logging in:

// 1. provide a cookie jar with existing cookies (see `tough-cookie`)
const helper = new Learn2018Helper({ cookieJar });
// 2. provide nothing, but invoking login with username and password
const helper = new Learn2018Helper();
// 3. provide a CredentialProvider function, which can be async
const helper = new Learn2018Helper({
  provider: () => ({ username, password }),
});

// Note that by using the following two methods you may encounter problems like login time out.
// But if you provide a credential provider, the library will retry logging in when failing, automatically resolving the cookie expiry problem.
// So we strongly recommend using this method.

// If you do not provide a cookie jar or CredentialProvider, you must log in manually. Otherwise you do not need to call login explicitly.
try {
  await helper.login(username, password);
} catch (e) {
  // e is a FailReason
}

// You can also take out cookies (e.g. for file download), which will not work in browsers.
console.log(helper.cookieJar);

// Logout if you want, but the cookie jar will not be cleared.
await helper.logout();
```

### Content related

We currently support both student and teacher (or TA) version of web learning. To keep backwards compatibility, the **default behavior of all APIs is to use the student version**. The following APIs needs `CourseType.TEACHER` as the last (optional) parameter to access the teacher version. You **should use them when you are the teacher / TA** of one course, for you will get nothing from the student version in that case.

We do not maintain a global type in `Learn2018Helper` class, for there can be the situation that one can be a student and teacher of the same course simultaneously, on which by using different `CourseType` you can get different results.

- `getCourseList`
- `getNotificationList/getFileList/getHomeworkList/getDiscussionList/getAnsweredQuestionList`
- `getAllContents`

Note that currently fetching homework information from teacher version is **partially implemented**.

```typescript
import { ContentType, ApiError } from 'thu-learn-lib';

// get ids of all semesters that current account has access to
const semesters = await helper.getSemesterIdList();

// get get semester info
const semester = await helper.getCurrentSemester();

// get courses of this semester
const courses = await helper.getCourseList(semester.id);
const course = courses[0];

// get detail information about the course
const discussions = await helper.getDiscussionList(course.id);
const notifications = await helper.getNotificationList(course.id);
const files = await helper.getFileList(course.id);
const homework = await helper.getHomeworkList(course.id);
const questions = await helper.getAnsweredQuestionList(course.id);

// get content from bunches of courses
// the return type will be { [id: string]: Content }
// where Content = Notification | File | Homework | Discussion | Question
const homeworks = await helper.getAllContents([1, 2, 3], ContentType.HOMEWORK);

// get course calendar in a period
try {
  const calendar = await helper.getCalendar('20191001', '20191201');
} catch (e) {
  const error = e as ApiError;
  // check e.reason and e.extra for information
  // you might want to check your date format or shrink the range (currently we observe a limit of 29 days)
}
```

According to security strategies (CORS, CORB) of browsers, you might need to run the code in the page context of `https://learn.tsinghua.edu.cn` and `https://id.tsinghua.edu.cn`. The simplest way is to run the code in Node.js or in [browser extension](#development-in-browser).

## Typing

See `src/types.ts` for type definitions. Note that `ApiError` represents the type that will be used in rejected Promises.

## Testing

Run `yarn test` for testing. It requires your personal credential since we don't have mocks for these APIs. To do this, you must touch a `.env` similar to `template.env` under /test folder.

It's ok if you meet `Timeout * Async callback was not invoked within the 5000ms timeout...` error when running tests, rerun tests may resolve this problem. If you hate this, just add the third argument `timeout` to every testcase `it("should...", async () => void, timeout)` and make sure it's greater than 5000.
